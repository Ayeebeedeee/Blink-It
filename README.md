Hey viewer, this repo consist of a dashboard for business which I have created using power BI.
Firstly I took the dummy data and saved it in the form of an excel sheet.
Then began the analysis part like on what all the details should I make the dashboard.
After doing the analysis, then came the part of visualization. What charts should I use and graphs, etc.
I prefered power BI over tableau this time as it gave me some new features for example, a donut chart, which tableau public doesn't provide us.
